I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Chair for Computational Modeling in Psychology](https://www.psy.uni-muenchen.de/comppsy/index.html) at LMU Munich. My research is at the intersection of psychological methods and cognitive psychology. Among others, I am interested in how Bayesian statistical methods can improve research efficiency, how expert knowledge can be incorporated into statistical models, and in how people formulate and update their beliefs in the light of data. As an Open Science advocate, I publish all materials, code, and data related to my research, as well as most of my teaching materials on [OSF](https://osf.io/fm6qd) and [GitHub](https://github.com/astefan1). If you're interested in my work, then please feel free to [contact me](mailto:angelika.m.stefan@gmail.com)!
